Users can configure a Data Pipeline (Data Flow) to sequence, filter, stream data and specify a data store based on your business logic. A typical pipeline configuration consists of activities that define the messaging protocol to receive data, define operations on the data (filtering, streaming, inferencing, rules) and the data stores. This section will guide you through all the steps required to create data pipelines.\nPrerequisites Prerequisite 1: Device Groups Configuration Before you begin, make sure the messaging protocols, data stores and models configuration for device groups have been configured. See here.\nAdding Data Pipelines Step 1: Open Pipeline Editor From the Gateways page, select the Device Group you want to configure and click Pipeline Editor Icon.\nStep 2: The Pipelines Editor page should be displayed. Step 3: Subscribe to device events On the editor canvas, right click and select the Data Subscriber activity.\nMost data pipelines start subscribing to events coming from devices. The Data Subscriber activity allows users to select the source of the device data.\nStep 4: Configure Data Subscriber On the activity configuration panel, select and review the messaging protocol\nAll the messaging protocols that have previously been configured in the Device Groups Configuration will be available for selection. Select the source for device events.\nStep 5: Filter device data (Optional) Select the devices to filter by selecting the Filter Activity.\nData can be filtered from going through the pipeline. Right click on the editor canvas and select Filters.\nStep 6: Configure filter activity On the activity configuration panel, select device and resource (sensors) data to be filtered. Only the sensor data/resources selected in the list will be propagated through the pipeline. Connect activities by selecting the connection ports.\nStep 7: Publish device data On the editor canvas, right click and select the Data Publisher activity.\nDevice data can be published to any messaging protocol that has been previously configured in the Device Groups connection pages.\nStep 8: Configure Data Publisher On the activity configuration panel, select and review the messaging protocol\nAll the messaging protocols that have previously been configured in the Device Groups Configuration will be available for selection. Select the destination for device events.\nStep 9: Name and Save Data Pipeline. After entering pipeline name, deployment target and deployer type, save the pipeline configuration. The configuration can then be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster either local or on the cloud.\nDeploying Data Pipelines Once data pipelines have been configured, they can be deployed dynamically to Kubernetes cluster running locally or on the cloud.\nStep 1: Select the desired pipeline from the Pipelines table and then click Deploy Pipeline Step 2: The pipeline is deployed and should show the Status as Ready/Deployed Updeploying Data Pipelines If data from a device is no longer required or if needs to be modified, you can undeploy the pipeline. Undeploying will remove the engine processing the data from the Kubernetes cluster.\nStep 1: Select the desired pipeline from the Pipelines table and then click Undeploy Pipeline Step 2: The pipeline is undeployed and should show the Status as Undeployed/Saved Deleting Data Pipelines If data pipelines are not longer required, you can delete the pipeline. Notice that deployed pipelines can’t be deleted. They need to be undeployed first.\nStep 1: Select the desired pipeline from the Pipelines table and then click Delete Pipeline Step 2: The pipeline is deleted and should not appear in the Pipelines table.
