Users can configure a Data Pipeline to sequence, filter, stream data and specify a data store based on your business logic. A typical pipeline configuration consists of activities that define the messaging protocol to receive data, define operations on the data (filtering, streaming, rules) and the data stores. This section will guide you through all the steps required to create data pipelines.\nPrerequisites Prerequisite 1: Device Groups Configuration Before you begin, make sure the messaging protocols and data stores configuration for device groups have been configured. See Configuring Device Groups.\nAdding Data Pipelines Step 1: From the Gateways page, select the Device Group you want to configure and click Data Pipelines. Step 2: The Data Pipelines page should be displayed. Step 3: On the Steps Panel, select the type of Pipeline and then click Next. You can configure pipelines for device data as well as pipelines for notificatios.\nStep 4: Select and review the messaging protocol and then click Next All the messaging protocols that have previously been configured in the Device Groups Configuration will be available for selection\nStep 5: Select the devices to filter and then click Next. Data can be filtered from going through the pipeline.\nStep 6: Configure streaming operations for a device instrument and then click Next TIBCO Project AIR allows users to perform streaming operations on instrument data. For example you can aggregate the values on a time window and prapagate only the results of the aggregation operation.\nStep 7: Select and review the data store and then click Next All the data stores that have previously been configured in the Device Groups Configuration will be available for selection\nStep 8: Click Save Data Pipeline button. Save the pipeline configuration. The configuration can then be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster either local or on the cloud.\nDeploying Data Pipelines Once data pipelines have been configured, they can be deployed dynamically to Kubernetes cluster running locally or on the cloud.\nStep 1: Select the desired pipeline from the Pipelines table and then click Deploy Pipeline Step 2: The pipeline is deployed and should show the Status as Deployed/Ready Updeploying Data Pipelines If data from a device is not longer required or if needs to be modified, you can undeploy the pipeline. Undeploying will remove the engine processing the data from the Kubernetes cluster.\nStep 1: Select the desired pipeline from the Pipelines table and then click Undeploy Pipeline Step 2: The pipeline is undeployed and should show the Status as Undeployed Deleting Data Pipelines If data pipelines are not longer required, you can delete the pipeline. Notice that deployed pipelines can’t be deleted. They need to be undeployed first.\nStep 1: Select the desired pipeline from the Pipelines table and then click Delete Pipeline Step 2: The pipeline is deleted and should not appear in the Pipelines table.

This section will guide you through all the steps to inspect device metadata as well as how to visualize data generated by the devices.\nPrerequisites Prerequisite 1: Edgex Connection In order to access device metadata, Project Air needs to be configured to access an Edgex Gateway. See Manage Device Groups\nPrerequisite 2: Device Groups Configuration Before you can see device data, make sure the messaging protocols and data stores configuration for device groups have been configured. See Configuring Device Groups.\nInspecting Device Metadata Step 1: From the Main Menu, select Devices. Step 2: Select the Device Group for the devices you want to inspect. Step 3: Viewing all devices The list of devices available will be displayed. Now you can select any of those devices to see the metadata and data details\nStep 4: Inspect Device Latest Data and Metadata Select a device from the Devices table (1) to see a summary of the current data sent by the device instruments (2) and a list of the instrument with a description for each of them (3)\nStep 5: Inspecting Device Metadata Select an instrument from the Instruments table (1) to view the device metadata information (2) like data value type, minimun value, maximun value, etc.\nStep 6: Visualizing Data Data will also be visualized. Data is viewved depending the data type. For example, for an instrument emitting status information (discrete value), a timeline is displayed showing the different states and times the instrument has been on that state.\nStep 7: Visualizing time series data Selecting a different instrument, the metadata and data information will be displayed. For example, the Voltage instrument emits numeric data. In that case, a chart with a history of values is displayed.\nStep 8: Viewing Streaming Data If the device is transmitting data, the last chart will display an streaming chart with the latest values transmitted by the device\nStep 9: Visualization for different data types As indicated previously, different visualization can be used for different data types. In this example, data from a vehicle will be shown\nStep 10: Visualizing geo location data Selecting an instrument with geo location data will display the position of the instrument on a map.\n","excerpt":"TIBCO Project Air has the capabilities to inspect edge devices …","ref":"/labs-air/docs/users-guide/inspecting-devices/","title":"Inspecting Devices"},{"body":"Introduction TIBCO Project Air enables users to work with data at the edge. The user can configure rules that can be applied to device data before it is sent to the cloud. It also provides capabilities to configure rules to trigger actions on other devices if a condition is met. A typical rule configuration consists of conditions on the values of a device, and actions to be taken when the conditions are met. This section will guide you through all the steps required to create edge rules.\nPrerequisites Prerequisite 1: Device Groups Configuration Before you begin, make sure the messaging protocols and data stores configuration for device groups have been configured. This is required if the rule will be configured to send notifications to the cloud. See Configuring Device Groups.\nAdding Edge Rules Step 1: From the Main Menu, select Edge Rules. Step 2: Select the Device Group for which the rule is going to be configured for. Step 3: On the Rule Definition panel, configure the rule by enter the following information and then click Add Rule  Rule Name Rule Description Enter conditions  Select Device Select a metric (instrument) on the device Select the conditions to apply and configure the operation and values to compare to.   Enter actions  Select the actions to apply and configure the notification or action to be sent to another device.    The configuration can then be deployed dynamically to the edge.\nStep 4: Rule is saved for later use and deployment. Deploying Rules Once the rules have been configured, they can be deployed dynamically to a rules engine running at the edge.\nStep 1: Select the desired rule from the Rules table Step 2: Review rule and click the Deploy Rule button. Viewing Notifications Rules can be configured to send notifications to cloud applications and data stores. The followin steps show how to view notifications.\nStep 1: From the Main Menu, select Notifications. Step 2: Review all notifications Updating Rules If a rule needs to be modified, make sure the rule is first undeployed and then update conditions and actions.\nStep 1: Select the desired rule from the Rules table and then click Update Rule Step 2: The rule is updated Updeploying Rules If a rule is not longer required or if needs to be modified, you can undeploy the rule. Undeploying will remove the rule from the rule engine running on the edge.\nStep 1: Select the desired rule from the Rules table and then click Undeploy Rule Step 2: The rule is undeployed Deleting Rules If rules are not longer required, you can delete the rule. Notice that deployed rules can’t be deleted. They need to be undeployed first.\nStep 1: Select the desired rule from the Rules table and then click Delete Rule Step 2: The rule is deleted and should not appear in the Rules table.
